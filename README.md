# Binary to Decimal

Create a method that, given a binary string representation of a number, returns its decimal value.

If the argument is *null* or empty, or if a digit isn't 1 or 0, throw an `IllegalArgumentException`.

Here's the numbers 0 to 9 represented as base 2 (binary):

```
   "0"	0
   "1"	1
  "10"	2
  "11"	3
 "100"	4
 "101"	5
 "110"	6
 "111"	7
"1000"	8
"1001"	9
```
