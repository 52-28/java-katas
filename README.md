# Katas

In order to train a kata, you need to checkout its corresponding branch :

``` bash
git checkout kata_name
```

Then read its description from the `README.md`, and :

* edit the class in the path `/src/kata`
* add tests in the path `/src/test`

And finally compile with the *bash* script :

``` bash
./tester.sh
```
