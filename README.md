# Worms Arena

Two worms fight into an arena : there can be only one !

Each worm has a number of life and attack points. When a fight begins, each worm attack in turn, until one of them doesn't have any life point.

The rules stipulate that each turn, the worms with the lowest life points attacks first.

Return the victorious worm !
