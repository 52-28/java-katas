# Count Minors

Create a method which counts how many minors are found in an integer array.

In order to accommodate each country laws, you will also take the legal age as parameter.

If the integer array is *null* or if the legal age is negative, return -1 instead.

*E.g:*
```
ages : {12, 16, 23, 47, 5, 16, 21}
legalAge : 18

result : 4
```
